This project aims to predict the likelihood of successful debt collection by analyzing the statute-barred status ("IsStatBarred") of accounts. The dataset includes features 
such as original creditor information, balances, purchase dates, and other relevant attributes.

Features:
Machine Learning Model: Developed a classification model to determine the statute-barred status of accounts.
Deep Learning Optimization: Integrated an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.
Data Processing & Feature Engineering: Preprocessed financial data, handled missing values, and optimized feature selection.
Performance Improvement: Achieved significant accuracy improvements through deep learning methodologies.

This repository contains the dataset preprocessing scripts, model training code, evaluation metrics, and insights gained from the analysis.
